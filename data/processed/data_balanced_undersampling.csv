negative,1.0,American,@AmericanAir what sense is it to charge for a bag service when the service isn't great. Losing luggage and now missing items this is bs
negative,1.0,American,"@AmericanAir when you strand someone in a city without luggage you would think AA would want to earn your business, but guess not?"
negative,1.0,American,@AmericanAir while I'm aggravated - shouldn't baggage fees disappear now that gas prices have dropped?

negative,1.0,American,@AmericanAir why does your RTW planner (spec. Circle Pacific) not let me even plan the demo routes from your website?
negative,1.0,American,"@AmericanAir why does your customer service line say ""we are experiencing high call volume"" and then spontaneously hangup on the person?"
negative,1.0,American,@AmericanAir why have I been on hold for almost 3 hours? This is ridiculous
negative,1.0,American,@AmericanAir why is there only one checkpoint open at JFK terminal 8? Ridiculous.
negative,1.0,American,@AmericanAir why would I even consider continuing your point program when I received no perks or continued bad customer service? #senseless
negative,1.0,American,@AmericanAir why would it take that long? My credit card company says the card hasn't been charged yet. Should it take 5 days for this?
